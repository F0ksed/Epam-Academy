Nothing ever happens in this town
Feeling low down, not a lot to do around here
I thought that I would go right out of my mind
Until a friend told me the news
He said, "Hey, you know that vacant lot
Right beside the gas station? Well, somebody bought it
And on that spot they're gonna build a shop
Where we can go buy bolts and screws"

Since then I've been walking on air
I can barely brush my teeth or comb my hair
Cause I'm so excited and I really don't care
I've been waiting since last June
For this day to finally arrive
I'm so happy now just to be alive
Cause any minute now I'm gonna be inside
Well, I hope they open soon
